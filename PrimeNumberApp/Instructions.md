## Prime Number Exercise

Create a Console app that can identify if a number is a prime number (a number that cannot be divided by anything but 1 and itself). 
Don’t depend on Console.WriteLine.

Get all the factors for a given number (besides 1 and itself). Also get a list of all the prime factors for a given number. 
When a number is given, print out how many unique factors go into it, the list of unique prime factors, and what the largest prime factor is.
