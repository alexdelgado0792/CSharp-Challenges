## Palindrome Exercise

Create a Console app that can identify if a word is a palindrome (the same forward and backwards like racecar). 
Create an overload method to check an int to see if it is a palindrome.

Ignore spacing, casing, and special characters when identifying palindromes. For instance, “stack cats” is a palindrome. 
Also create an overload method to handle doubles as well (so 12.321 is a palindrome).
