# FizzBuzz Exercise

Create a Console app that prints out Fizz when a number is divisible by 3, Buzz when divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz when divisible by 3 and 5. Create it as simply as possible.

Then refactor again to add in Jazz (7) and to accept any bounds (handle special number(s) correctly). Write it so that it can add more checks without adding more code.
